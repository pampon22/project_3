# project_3
CI/CD Pipeline. Creating a To-Do Web App using Flask, GitHub Actions, TDD, and Heroku

every time code is pushed, we want to :
  TDD tests to run automatically to get a report of the passed and failed tests.
  Lint our code to see any style issues that are usually associated with low quality code.
  Build our code on an Ubuntu server.
  Configure a Heroku server to run our website.
  Deploy our website to Heroku so customers can use it.
